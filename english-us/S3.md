Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service that allows you to store and retrieve data from anywhere on the web. It is designed to scale limitlessly, allowing you to store and retrieve massive amounts of data with high availability and durability.
<details><summary> <h3>Features</h3></summary>
<ul>
    <li><b>Scalability:</b> S3 can store virtually an unlimited amount of objects and can be configured to store up to 5 TB per object.</li>
    <li><b>Durability:</b> S3 is designed to ensure objects are durable, with a durability rate of 99.999999999%.</li>
    <li><b>Availability:</b> S3 is highly available, with an SLA of 99.9%.</li>
    <li><b>Access management:</b> S3 allows management of object access through access policies, access control lists (ACLs), and identity-based authentication.</li>
    <li><b>Integration with other AWS services:</b> S3 can easily integrate with other AWS services, such as EC2, Glacier, and EBS.</li>
</ul>

<details><summary> <h3>Terms and Concepts</h3></summary>
<ul>
<li><b>Buckets:</b> Containers for S3 objects. All objects are stored in a bucket.</li>
<li><b>Objects:</b> The data stored in S3 is called objects. Each object is composed of data and metadata (information about the object).</li>
<li><b>Key:</b> An object's key is a unique identifier for that object in the bucket.</li>
<li><b>Versions:</b> S3 stores all versions of objects that have been changed, allowing you to retrieve previous versions if necessary.</li>
<li><b>Lifecycle:</b> S3 provides a way to manage the lifecycle of objects, allowing you to configure rules to automatically archive or delete objects based on their lifetime.</li>
<li><b>Storage Classes:</b> S3 offers several storage classes for objects, each with different durability, availability, and cost characteristics.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Configure appropriate access control policies to limit access to stored objects</li>
  <li>Use S3's encryption options to protect sensitive data</li>
  <li>Configure lifecycle rules for old and unused objects to reduce costs</li>
  <li>Use versioning and access control options to track and manage changes to stored objects</li>
  <li>Monitor S3 usage and set alerts for anomalies or security issues</li>
</ul>
