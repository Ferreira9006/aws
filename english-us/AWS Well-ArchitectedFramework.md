The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides a consistent approach for evaluating architectures and implementing designs that scale over time. It offers a set of best practices to help customers design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the cloud.

The framework is built around six pillars: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, and Sustainability.

<details><summary><h3>Components</h3></summary>

#### Operational Excellence

<div align="center">

</div>

Operational Excellence focuses on running and monitoring systems to deliver business value and continually improving processes and procedures. This pillar includes principles for organization, preparation, operation, and evolution to support the development and operations lifecycle.

#### Security

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/4744/4744315.png" width="25%">
</div>

The Security pillar encompasses the ability to protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage of cloud technologies. It includes implementing a strong identity foundation, enabling traceability, automating security best practices, protecting data in transit and at rest, and preparing for security events.

#### Reliability

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/12376/12376658.png" width="25%">
</div>

Reliability focuses on the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service failures, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues. Key design principles include testing recovery procedures, automatically recovering from failure, and scaling horizontally.

#### Performance Efficiency

<div align="center">

</div>

Performance Efficiency is the efficient use of computing resources to meet requirements and maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve. Design principles include democratizing advanced technologies, using serverless architectures, experimenting more often, and considering mechanical sympathy.

#### Cost Optimization

<div align="center">

</div>

Cost Optimization involves the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. Key principles include adopting a consumption model, measuring overall efficiency, stopping spending on undifferentiated heavy lifting, and analyzing and attributing expenditure.

#### Sustainability

<div align="center">
