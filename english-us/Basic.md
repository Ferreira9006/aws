<br>

##### A server is composed by:

- Compute: CPU 
- Memory: RAM 
- Storage: Data
- Database: Store data in a structured way
- Network: Routers, switch, DNS server
  - Network: cables, routers and servers connected with each other
  - Router: a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. They know where to send your packets on the internet!
  - Switch: takes a packet and send it to the correct server / client on your network

##### Problems with traditional IT approach

- Pay for the rent for the data center
- Pay for powe supply, cooling, maintenance
- Adding and replacing hardware takes time
- Scaling is limited
- Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure
- How to deal with disasters? (easthquake, power shutdown, fire...)

Can all this be externalized?
