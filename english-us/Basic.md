<br>

##### A server is composed by:

- Compute: CPU 
- Memory: RAM 
- Storage: Data
- Database: Store data in a structured way
- Network: Routers, switch, DNS server
  - Network: cables, routers and servers connected with each other
  - Router: a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. They know where to send your packets on the internet!
  - Switch: takes a packet and send it to the correct server / client on your network

##### Problems with traditional IT approach

- Pay for the rent for the data center
- Pay for powe supply, cooling, maintenance
- Adding and replacing hardware takes time
- Scaling is limited
- Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure
- How to deal with disasters? (easthquake, power shutdown, fire...)

Can all this be externalized?

##### Infrastrucure as a Service (IaaS)
  
- Provide building blocks for cloud IT
- Provides networking, computers, data storage space
- Highest level of flexibility
- Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
- Example
   <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <td> - Amazon EC2</td>
      <td><img src="https://d2q66yyjeovezo.cloudfront.net/icon/d43b67a293d39d11b046bd1813c804cb-4bc0ce71c93950e1ad695b25a4f1d4b5.svg" /></td>
    </table>

##### Plataform as a Service (PaaS)
  
- Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infraestructure
- Focus on the deployment and management of you applications
- Example
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <td>- Elastic Beanstalk</td>
    <td><img src="https://d2q66yyjeovezo.cloudfront.net/icon/d88319dfa5d204f019b4284149886c59-7d586ea82f792b61a8c87de60565133d.svg" /></td>
  </table>
  
   
   
##### Software as a Service (SaaS)  
- Completed product that us run and managed by the service provider
- Example   
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <td>- Many AWS Services (ex: Rekognition for Machine Learning) </td>
