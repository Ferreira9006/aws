The AWS Snow Family is a set of physical devices designed to securely and efficiently transfer data between on-premises environments and the AWS Cloud. These devices help organizations with large data volumes to overcome challenges related to data transfer, migration, and edge computing. It's helps when you need to run operations in austere, non-data center environments, and in locations where there's a lack of consistent network connectivity. 

The Snow Family, comprised of AWS Snowcone, AWS Snowball, and AWS Snowmobile, offers a number of physical devices and capacity points with built-in computing capabilities.
